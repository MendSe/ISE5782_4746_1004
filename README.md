**Ray Tracing 3D Renderer in Java**

This project is a 3D rendering engine built in Java that simulates ray tracing from scratch to model and render realistic 3D objects. The application uses object-oriented programming (OOP) principles and advanced techniques to create complex geometries, lighting, and shading effects.

### Key Features:
- **Object-Oriented Design**: Utilizes OOP to structure geometries, lighting, primitives, and rendering modules in a clean, reusable way.
- **Ray Tracing Engine**: Implements ray tracing algorithms to calculate the interaction of light with surfaces, creating realistic visuals with reflections, refractions, and shadows.
- **Bounding Volume Hierarchies (BVH)**: Incorporates BVH structures for efficient scene management, enhancing rendering performance by reducing the number of ray-object intersection tests.
- **Lighting and Shading**: Supports multiple light sources (ambient, directional, point, and spotlight) to simulate realistic lighting. Materials can be customized with properties like shininess, reflection, and transparency.
- **Multithreading**: Enables multithreaded rendering for performance optimization, making the engine capable of handling complex scenes efficiently.
- **Sample Rendered Scene**: Includes a 3D-rendered tank scene, showcasing the capabilities of the engine in rendering detailed objects with proper lighting and shading.
